# competitive-programming-template-CPP
Template for competitive programming contests. Includes most-used libraries, shortened keywords/functions, and common variables for faster coding. I/O is file-based for convenience and to meet contest requirements. Just open the files and run the code!

In the code you can check the shortened verions of keywords/functions after the "using namespace std;". For example, long long type is now just ll, and long double is ld.

You will need to change N variable based on the problem, I used it for the size of the array. And mod is self-expalanatory

debugMode() function is to establish and to increase the speed of the file based I/O. You can change the name of the I/O files in fropen functions
The I/O though done traditionally with cin >> and cout <<

Thats all to now! Modify the template for your needs and good luck on the contests, win'em all
